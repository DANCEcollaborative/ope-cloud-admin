- Click on the `Launch OPE` button at the end of this panel, which will redirect you to your designated OPE session. **Note: if you do not see any new browser tab or window when clicking the button, make sure you have allowed pop-ups in your browser. Check the URL address bar to see the blocked pop-up and enable it to join the OPE session.**

- In the Jupyter window, click on the "Chat" button on the right navigation bar.

- Introduce yourself to your teammates and follow the the bot's instructions to begin `Task 1`. Subsequent tasks will be appended to the same `workspace.ipynb` notebook once you have finished the current task.

- Once all three tasks are complete or when the session is about to end, the "submit cell" will appear in the `workspace.ipynb` notebook. **Only one team member** is required to run this cell, which will submit the work for the entire team.

- After submission, your post-quiz OPE token will be displayed below the "submit cell." Copy this token and navigate to the "Post OPE Quiz" section of this module on Sail() to unlock and complete your post-quiz.

- Before leaving the JupyterLab session, make sure to verify that your submission has been recorded on the Sail() platform. To do this, click on the "My Submissions" tab on this Sail() page. Your submission details will be used by the course staff to determine the completion status and/or grade you receive for the OPE activity.
