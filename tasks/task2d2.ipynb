    "You can use historical workload data to estimate how much to scale out at time. Or if you know about the vendors coming online, you can use information about them to estimate how much to scale out. You can use short metric aggregation periods to know when to scale back in if you scale out too much. While waiting for scaling out to take effect, you can throttle to preserve resources by delaying transaction reports and bill generation.\n",
